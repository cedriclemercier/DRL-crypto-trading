# Deep Reinforcement Learning Models Performance for Crypto-currency Trading

**Abstract**

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has proven to
be a viable way for automatic portfolio management in many
financial investment products, including the top cryptocurrencies
in market capitalisation. However, implementing a practical
and beginner-friendly DRL agent can be difficult because of
the different goals, strategies, and libraries available. In this
paper, we are implementing the [FinRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL) has proven to

the different goals, strategies, and libraries available. In this
paper, we are implementing the FinRL library for automated
cryptocurrency trading and comparing the different agents across
several librairies on different trading strategies. Furthermore, we
are exploring the viability of the models by validating during
periods or turmoil and bear trend, allowing an assessment of
whether they are viable even in bad market conditions. Our
models were trained and tested on the top 10 cryptocurrencies
